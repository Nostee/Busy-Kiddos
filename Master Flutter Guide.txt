CHAPTER 1 - THEORIES

# Creating the main() function of your flutter app.
// Note: Example Only:
void main() => runApp(MaterialApp(
	home: *name of your class*()
));

// Note: void main() is the fuction that our app will run first.
// Note: startApp() is a function that runs a widget at the startup.

# Creating a stateless widget.
1. Type "stless" and it will automatically create the code for you.
2. Name the class.
3. Return a widget. Preferrably Scaffold().

// Note: Example Only:
class *any name* extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
		//put anything here.
    );
  }
}

# Creating a statful widget.
1. Type "stful" and it will automatically create the code for you.
2. Name the class.
3. Return a widget in the second created class. Preferrably Scaffold().

// Note: Example Only:
class Test extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TestState createState() => _TestState();
}

class _TestState extends State<Test> {
  //intialize any data here.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
		//put anything here.
	);
  }
}

# Converting to stateful/stateless widget.
1. Just click the state after the "extend".
2. Choose your new state. 

# How to display data in your widgets.
// Note: Example Only:
int ctr = 0;
*when using in widget*
"$ctr"
//always use in a string then put a dollar sign before the variable.

# When manipulating data in a function. Always put your code in the setState(() {}). It also works even if the function is empty.
// Note: Example Only:
onPressed: () {
          setState(() {
            myLevel = myLevel+1;
            print("Log: Added some level!");
          });
		  

*name_of_variable is a list.
*any_variable_name will act as a receiver of data from the list.
		  
# Creating your own class.
1. Create a new file. (first letter should be a smaller case)
2. The class name should be the same with 
   the file name but the first letter should be upper case.
2. Initialize your variables.
3. Import your file to your main class.

"Note: Creating your own class is like creating your own data type with different properties."
// Note: Example Only(creating your own class)
class Person
{
	String name;
	String age;
	
	Person({this.name , this.age})
}
// Note: Example Only(importing)
import "person.dart";

# Assigning data to your class (mostly done in a list).
List<Person> people = [
	Person(name: "Jedidiah",age: "20")
	]

# When getting a data from the property of a custom class.
1. Should be inside the ${object.property}
// Note: Example Only
children: people.map((human){
return Text("Name is ${human.name}, ${human.age} years old.")
})

# Creating a Widget Class.
1. Create a new file. Name it the same with the name of the class. (Lowercase for convention's sake)
2. Create a stateless widget. The class name should be uppercase. 
3. Create a final variable name of the object that will be used.
4. Create a constructor that gives data to the final variable.
5. Import the files imported by the main file.
// Note: Example Only
class QuoteTemplate extends StatelessWidget {
  final Quotes myQuote;
  QuoteTemplate({this.myQuote});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(myQuote.author);
  }
}

// Note: Wor when calling a widget class.
children: myQuote.map((x) {
		return QuoteTemplate(myQuote: x);
	  }).toList(),

# Creating a function object.
1. Create a function object.
2. This is mostly created in custom widgets.
// Note: Example Only
final Function delete; 

Notes: 
1. "delete" is the variable name
2. "Function" is an object.

// Note: Example when delivering the data of the custom function from the main class
children: myQuote.map((x) {
                return QuoteTemplate(
                    myQuote: x, //disregard this. focus on the delete
                    delete: () {
                      setState(() {
                        myQuote.remove(x);
                      });
                    }
                );
              }).toList(),

// Note: When calling the function from the custom class
onPressed: () 
{
     delete();
}

# Creating multiple pages and how to navigate through them.
1. Create custom classes then import the material app in each file. 
2. In your main class, create a routes property. (Go to the MaterialApp() section in order to understand on how to use this property.)
3. Put some destination in your routes property. 
4. In order to navigate to a page, add a Navigator. object to the function of a particular button.
   // Note: Example Only:
	onPressed: () {
		Navigator.pushNamed(context, "/whateverlocation"); 
		/or/
		Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, "/whateverlocation"); 
		/or/
		Naviagtor.pop(context, {}) //goes back to the initial screen
	}
	
# Passing data to other page.
1. Add an additional argument named "arguments:" to the Navigator. object. //when popping, "arguments: " is not needed anymore.
2. Put a map inside the argument. 
	// Note: Example Only:
	onPressed: () {
		Navigator.pushReplacedNamed(context, "/whateverlocation",arguments: {
			'location' : wt.location,
			'flag' : wt.flag,
			'currentTime' : wt.currentTime,
		}); 
	}
3. Go to the page that you will navigate into.
4. Initialize a map data. (outside of build)
5. Give the map variable a ModalRoute. object. (inside the build)
	// Note: Example Only:
	class _HomeState extends State<Home> {

	  Map myData;

	  @override
	  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
		myData = ModalRoute.of(context).settings.arguments;
		return Scaffold()
	  }
 
# Navigator Pop and Data Return Combo
1. From the main class:
		onPressed: () async 
		{
		  dynamic result = await Navigator.pushNamed(context,"/chooseLocation");
		  myData = {
			"location": result["location"],
			"currentTime": result["currentTime"]
			};
			setState(() {});
		}
2. From the other class:
		Navigator.pop(context, 
		{
        "location": wt.location,
        "currentTime": wt.currentTime,
		});

# Implementing a function that runs once the custom class run.
1. Just right after the class state, type initstate and it will automatically code for you.
2. Remove TO DO line.
	// Note: Example Only:
	@override
	void initState()
	{
		super.initState();
		print("It runs.");
	}

# Creating a Asynchronous function. (A function that runs after several time after.)
1. Create a void function and name it whatever you want.
2. Put a Future. object that handles delayed().
3. Enter a duration and another function inside the delayed property.
4. Then put a "async" right after the function name. (After the "()")
5. If you want to finish a function first before moving on to the next function, put an "await" before the line.
6. Always wrap void with Future.
	// Note: Example Only
	  Future<void> delayedRun() async
	  {
		await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3),() {
		  print("3 seconds has passed.");
		});
	  }
	  
# Putting data into variables with Asynchronous function.
1. Initialize a variable then put a Future. object in it. (Including the properties)
2. Inside the nested function, return a value.
3. Do not forget the "async". For some reason, you can't return a value without it.
	// Note: Example Only
	Future<void> delayedRun() async
	{
		String username = await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3),() {
			return "Nostee";
		})
	}
	
# Adding the HTTP package to flutter.
1. Go to pubspec.yaml
2. Under dependencies, add the package, http: ^0.12.0+2
	// Note: Example Only

 2. Put an "await" before the get() function.
 3. Inside the get() function, put this: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1'
 4. After the line, create a map object and put inside a jsonDecode() function. 
 5. Inside the jsonDecode() function, get the variable name of your response object and get the "body" property.
 6. You can now call your map variable.
 
 # Creating a date time object.
 1. Let's assume that you already got the property from the world time api and gave it to a String variable.
 2. Create a DateTime object and give it a variable name.
 3. Equate it to an another DateTime. object then parse(). 
 4. Inside the parse function, give it the variable that you assigned the date time property.
 
 # Adding an hour to the date time object.
 1. Get the variable name of your DateTime object then put a ".add()" to it.
 2. Add a Duration() function inside the add() function.
 3. Inside the duration() function, put "hours: " then put an integer right after it. 
	// Note: Example Only:
	Future<void> getTime() async
	  {
		Response manila = await get("http://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Asia/Manila");
		Map time = jsonDecode(manila.body); // getting the properties and putting it in a map
		String date = time["datetime"];	// getting the "datetime" property then putting it in a String
		String offset = time["utc_offset"].substring(1,3); // getting the "utc_offset" property then putting it in a String
														   // getting the numbers only by using substring()

		DateTime dt = DateTime.parse(date); 	// creating a DateTime object.
		dt = dt.add(Duration(hours: int.parse(offset)));	// add an hour to the current DateTime object.
		print("Time in manila is $dt");
	  }
 
# Formatting Dates.
1. Go to pubspec.yaml
2. Under dependencies, add the package, intl: ^0.15.8

3. Save file then get dependencies on the main class. 
4. import 'package:intl/intl.dart' on the file where you're gonna use the intl package.
5. Assign a DateFormat.jm().format() inside a String variable.
	// Note: Example Only
	currentTime = DateFormat.jm().format(dt); //this is for time only.
 
 # Creating a loading display
1. Go to pubspec.yaml
2. Under dependencies, add the package, flutter_spinkit: ^4.0.0

	  flutter_spinkit: ^4.0.0
3. Save file then get dependencies on the main class. 
4. import 'package:flutter_spinkit/flutter_spinkit.dart' on the file where you're gonna use the flutter_spinkit package.
5. Go to the website: pub.dev/packages/flutter_spinkit and choose a widget and place it in a child property.
	// Note: Example Only
	child: SpinKitRotatingCircle(
	  color: Colors.white,
	  size: 50.0,
	)
	
 # Using ternary operators.
 1. Shorcut if condition looks like this:
	// Note: Example Only
	bool checker = *condition* ? true : false;
	
 # Creating constants.
 Note: Use constants if you have multiple shared codes.
 1. Create a folder named shared
 2. Create a const variable
 3. Put a widget inside of it.
 4. Import the folder in the class where you'll be using the constants.
 5. Just call the variable name when using it.
 6. When adding properties, just add "variable_name.copyWith(property: value)"
 
# Validating User Input in Form Fields
1. Create a final variable containing GlobalKey object that has <FormState>() in the class where you use the Form() widget.
> final formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();
2. Put a key property and put the formKey inside it. (do this literally)
3. Inside a function (prefferably in onPressed), create an if statement. (this is inside where you're gonna get all the values of the form)
4. The condition is:
> if(formKey.currentState.validate())
> the condition statement returns true or false.
5. Create a validator property inside the TextFormFields that has a function with the value inside the parenthesis.
6. Return a null in the validator function if it's valid.
